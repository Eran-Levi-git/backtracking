#### ex_11_backtrack:

1. The function "general_backtracking" is a naive function for solving
backtracking problems.

#### ex11_sudoku:

1. The function "load_game" loads a text file of sudoku game into a dictionary.

2. The function "check_board" checking if input is valid

3. The function "run_game" is running the sudoku game.

####  ex11_map_coloring:

1. The function "read_adj_file" loads a text file of sudoku game
into a dictionary.

2. The function "run_map_coloring" this function solving the graph coloring
problem for given adjacency file.

3. the function "legal_assignment_func" this function will check if assignment
of color to name is legal.

####  ex11_improve_backtrack:

1. the function "back_track_degree_heuristic" in order to assign color to the
regions by their neighbors number, this function organizes the list of items
by the number of their neighbors from the maximum to the minimum.

In order to make the code more elegant, i had created the func
"run_map_coloring". this run map is almost similar to "run_map_coloring" from
ex11_map_coloring, but with a parameter called "backtrack_type".

2. the function "back_track_MRV" assigning colors to the regions by
the val that have the fewest number of legal assignments.
this function organizes the list of items by the number of their legal
assignments left, from the minimum to the maximum.

"specific_backtracking_MRV" is the parallel to general_backtracking.
this function is solving backtracking problems using MRV formula

3. the function "back_track_FC" is solving backtracking problems using FC
formula.

"legal_assignment_FC" is the parallel to "legal_assignment_func", but this one
also looks forward to make sure that a certain assignment isn't creating
a situation in which other name left with no legal assignment

4. the function "back_track_LCV" is solving backtracking problems using LCV
formula.

"specific_backtracking_LCV" is the parallel to general_backtracking.
this function is solving backtracking problems using LCV formula, which means
calling "LCV_check" function for making the LCV list.

5. the function "fast_back_track" is solving backtracking problems fastest way.
using MRV, FC and LCV.
